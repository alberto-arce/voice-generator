# Voice Generator

## Overview

This is a simple single-page application built with Next.js that utilizes the ElevenLabs API to convert text into voice. The app allows users to select a voice from a dropdown menu, enter text in a text area, and generate voice. Users can listen to the generated voice or download it directly.

## Features

- **Voice Selection**: Choose from various voices available via the ElevenLabs API.
- **Text Input**: Enter the text you want to convert to speech.
- **Character Count**: Displays the number of characters available for conversion based on your usage quota.
- **Voice Generation**: Generate voice from the provided text.
- **Playback and Download**: Play the generated voice or download it as an MP3 file.

## Environment Variables

To use the ElevenLabs API, you need to set up the following environment variables in your `.env` file:

- `ELEVENLABS_API_BASE_URL`: The base URL for the ElevenLabs API. Default is `https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1`. Change this if ElevenLabs updates the endpoint.
- `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`: Your ElevenLabs API key. Replace `<YOUR API KEY>` with your actual API key.
- `ELEVENLABS_API_MODEL_ID`: The ID of the model you want to use for generating voice.

Example `.env` file:

```bash
